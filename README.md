# pcb-faves-kicad

KiCad is awesome. It's really high quality software, and I've been learning a lot about the back end side of hardware design. Front end circuit design is looking at optimized logic, design, etc. Back end is full of things like noise prevention and signal integrity.

I come up with some circuits to design every now and then for fun. This repo is just a collection of the PCBs I've designed. I'll add a text file to describe each pcb later on.

I should add that I haven't printed anything yet since I don't have access to PCB printers right now. So I'm just using typical values for clearance and trace width and stuff, not pushing anything. I keep things between 2 and 4 layers.
